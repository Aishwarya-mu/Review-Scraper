What is a Web scraper?

Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. 

Web scrapping consists of two parts: 

• Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from them. 

• HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web crawling and then extracting specific information from it. 
Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and then extract the desired information from the website output.
